# Programming Minecraft with Websockets

Minecraft lets you connect to a websocket server when you're in a game. The server can receive and send any commands. This lets you build a bot that you can ... (well, I don't know what it can do, let's explore.)

Minecraft has [commands](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands) you can type on a chat window. For example, type `/` to start a command and type `setblock ~1 ~0 ~0 grass` changes the block 1 north of you into grass. (`~` means relative to you. Coordinates are specified as X, Y and Z.)

Note:

- These instructions were tested on Minecraft Bedrock 1.16 & 1.17. I haven't tested them on the Java Edition.

## Connect to Minecraft

You can send any command to Minecraft from a websocket server. Let's use JavaScript for this.

First, run `npm install ws uuid`. (We need [`ws`](https://npmjs.com/package/ws) for websockets and [`uuid`](https://npmjs.com/package/uuid) to generate unique IDs.)

Then create this [`mineserver1.js`](mineserver1.js):

```js
const WebSocket = require('ws')
const uuid = require('uuid')        // For later use

// Create a new websocket server on port 3000
console.log('Ready. On MineCraft chat, type /connect localhost:3000')
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3000 })

// On Minecraft, when you type "/connect localhost:3000" it creates a connection
wss.on('connection', socket => {
  console.log('Connected')
})
```

Run `node mineserver1.js`. Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window. You'll see 2 things:

1. MineCraft says "Connection established to server: ws://localhost:3000"
2. Node prints "Connected"

Now, our program is connected to Minecraft, and can send/receive messages.

![Minecraft chat connect](img/minecraft-chat-connected.png)

Notes:

- The Python equivalent is in [mineserver1.py](mineserver1.py). Run `python mineserver1.py`.
- If you get an `Uncaught Error: Cannot find module 'ws'`, make sure you ran `npm install ws uuid`.
- To disconnect, run `/connect off`.

## Subscribe to chat messages

Now let's listen to the players' chat.

A connected websocket server can send a "subscribe" message to Minecraft saying it wants to
"listen" to specific actions. For example, you can subscribe to "PlayerMessage". Whenever a player
sents a chat message, Minecraft will notify the websocket client.

Here's how to do that. Add this code in the `wss.on('connection', socket => { ... })` function.

```js
  // Tell Minecraft to send all chat messages. Required once after Minecraft starts
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    "header": {
      "version": 1,                     // We're using the version 1 message protocol
      "requestId": uuid.v4(),           // A unique ID for the request
      "messageType": "commandRequest",  // This is a request ...
      "messagePurpose": "subscribe"     // ... to subscribe to ...
    },
    "body": {
      "eventName": "PlayerMessage"      // ... all player messages.
    },
  }))
```

Now, every time a player types something in the chat window, the socket will receive it. Add this
code below the above code:

```js
  // When MineCraft sends a message (e.g. on player chat), print it.
  socket.on('message', packet => {
    const msg = JSON.parse(packet)
    console.log(msg)
  })
```

This code parses all the messages it receives and prints them.

This code in is [`mineserver2.js`](mineserver2.js). Run `node mineserver2.js`.
Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window.
Then type a message (e.g. "alpha") in the chat window.
You'll see a message like this in the console.

```js
{
  header: {
    messagePurpose: 'event',        // This is an event
    requestId: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
    version: 1                      // using version 1 message protocol

Notes:

- The Python equivalent is in [mineserver2.py](mineserver2.py). Run `python mineserver2.py`.
- The official Minecraft docs say that the [MCWSS protocol is outdated](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Commands/wsserver#Uses).
  But it seems to work.
- The full list of things we can subscribe to is undocumented, but
  [@jocopa3](https://gist.github.com/jocopa3/) has reverse-engineered a
  [list of messages](https://gist.github.com/jocopa3/5f718f4198f1ea91a37e3a9da468675c)
  we can subscribe to, and they're somewhat meaningful.
- [This Go package](https://github.com/Sandertv/mcwss/) has code that explores the
  [protocol](https://github.com/Sandertv/mcwss/tree/master/protocol) further.
- This [chat](https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/5ta719/mcpewin10_global_chat_using_websockets/)
  has more details. There's also an
  [outdated list of JSON messages](https://gist.github.com/jocopa3/54b42fb6361952997c4a6e38945e306f)
  from [@jocopa3](https://gist.github.com/jocopa3/).

## Build structures using chat

Let's create a pyramid of size `10` around us when we type `pyramid 10` in the chat window.

The first step is to check if the player sent a chat message like `pyramid 10` (or another number).
Add this code below the above code:

```js
  // When MineCraft sends a message (e.g. on player chat), act on it.
  socket.on('message', packet => {
    const msg = JSON.parse(packet)
    // If this is a chat window
    if (msg.body.eventName === 'PlayerMessage') {
      // ... and it's like "pyramid 10" (or some number), draw a pyramid
      const match = msg.body.properties.Message.match(/^pyramid (\d+)/i)
      if (match)
        draw_pyramid(+match[1])
    }
  })
```

If the user types "pyramid 3" on the chat window, `draw_pyramid(3)` is called.

In `draw_pyramid()`, let's send commands to build a pyramid. To send a command, we need to create a
JSON with the command (e.g. `setblock ~1 ~0 ~0 grass`). Add this code below the above code:

```js
  function send(cmd) {
    const msg = {
      "header": {
        "version": 1,
        "requestId": uuid.v4(),     // Send unique ID each time
        "messagePurpose": "commandRequest",
        "messageType": "commandRequest"
      },
      "body": {
        "version": 1,               // TODO: Needed?
        "commandLine": cmd,         // Define the command
        "origin": {
          "type": "player"          // Message comes from player
        }
      }
    }
    socket.send(JSON.stringify(msg))  // Send the JSON string
  }
```

Let's write `draw_pyramid()` to create a pyramid using glowstone by adding this code below the
above code:

```js
  // Draw a pyramid of size "size" around the player.
  function draw_pyramid(size) {
    // y is the height of the pyramid. Start with y=0, and keep building up
    for (let y = 0; y < size + 1; y++) {
      // At the specified y, place blocks in a rectangle of size "side"
      let side = size - y;
      for (let x = -side; x < side + 1; x++) {
        send(`setblock ~${x} ~${y} ~${-side} glowstone`)
        send(`setblock ~${x} ~${y} ~${+side} glowstone`)
        send(`setblock ~${-side} ~${y} ~${x} glowstone`)
        send(`setblock ~${+side} ~${y} ~${x} glowstone`)
      }
    }
  }
```

This code in is [`mineserver3.js`](mineserver3.js).

- Run `node mineserver3.js`.
- Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window.
- Then type `pyramid 3` in the chat window.
- You'll be surrounded by a glowstone pyramid.

![Minecraft glowstone pyramid](img/minecraft-glowstone-pyramid.png)

Notes:

- The Python equivalent is in [mineserver3.py](mineserver3.py). Run `python mineserver3.py`.
- The "requestId" needs to be a UUID -- at least for block commands. I tried unique "requestId"
  values like 1, 2, 3 etc. That didn't work.

## Understand Minecraft's responses

For every command you send, Minecraft sends a response. It's "header" looks like this:

```jsonc
{
  "header": {
    "version": 1,
    "messagePurpose": "commandResponse",                  // Response to your command
    "requestId": "97dee9a3-a716-4caa-aef9-ddbd642f2650"   // ... and your requestId
  }
}
```

If the command is successful, the response has `body.statusCode == 0`. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "body": {
    "statusCode": 0,                  // No error
    "statusMessage": "Block placed",  // It placed the block you wanted
    "position": { "x": 0, "y": 64, "z": 0 }   // ... at this location
  },
}
```

If the command failed, the response has a negative `body.statusCode`. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "body": {
    "statusCode": -2147352576,        // This is an error
    "statusMessage": "The block couldn't be placed"
  },
}
```

To print these, add this to `socket.on('message', ...)`:

```js
    // If we get a command response, print it
    if (msg.header.messagePurpose == 'commandResponse')
      console.log(msg)
```

This code in is [`mineserver4.js`](mineserver4.js).

- Run `node mineserver4.js`.
- Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window.
- Then type `pyramid 3` in the chat window.
- You'll be surrounded by a glowstone pyramid, and the *console will show every command response*.

Notes on common error messages:

- `The block couldn't be placed` (-2147352576):
  The same block was already at that location.
- `Syntax error: Unexpected "xxx": at "~0 ~9 ~-1 >>xxx<<"` (-2147483648):
  You gave wrong arguments to the command.
- `Too many commands have been requested, wait for one to be done` (-2147418109):
  Minecraft only allows 100 commands can be executed without waiting for their response.
- [More error messages here](https://github.com/CloudburstMC/Language/blob/master/en_GB.lang).

## Wait for commands to be done

Typing "pyramid 3" works just fine. But try "pyramid 5" and your pyramid is incomplete.

![Minecraft incomplete pyramid](img/minecraft-incomplete-pyramid.png)

That's because Minecraft only allows up to 100 messages in its queue. On the 101st message, you get
a `Too many commands have been requested, wait for one to be done` error.

```json
{
  "header": {
    "version": 1,
    "messagePurpose": "error",
    "requestId": "a5051664-e9f4-4f9f-96b8-a56b5783117b"
  },
  "body": {
    "statusCode": -2147418109,
    "statusMessage": "Too many commands have been requested, wait for one to be done"
  }
}
```

So let's modify `send()` to add to a queue and send in batches. We'll create two queues:

```js
  const sendQueue = []        // Queue of commands to be sent
  const awaitedQueue = {}     // Queue of responses awaited from Minecraft
```

In `wss.on('connection', ...)`, when Minecraft completes a command, we'll remove it from the
`awaitedQueue`. If the command has an error, we'll report it.

```js
    // If we get a command response
    if (msg.header.messagePurpose == 'commandResponse') {
      // ... and it's for an awaited command
      if (msg.header.requestId in awaitedQueue) {
        // Print errors 5(if any)
        if (msg.body.statusCode < 0)
          console.log(awaitedQueue[msg.header.requestId].body.commandLine, msg.body.statusMessage)
        // ... and delete it from the awaited queue
        delete awaitedQueue[msg.header.requestId]
      }
    }
    // Now, we've cleared all completed commands from the awaitedQueue.
```

Once we've processed Minecraft's response, we'll send pending messages from `sendQueue`, upto 100
and add them to the `awaitedQueue`.

```js
     // We can send new commands from the sendQueue -- up to a maximum of 100.
     let count = Math.min(100 - Object.keys(awaitedQueue).length, sendQueue.length)
     for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
       // Each time, send the first command in sendQueue, and add it to the awaitedQueue
       let command = sendQueue.shift()
       socket.send(JSON.stringify(command))
       awaitedQueue[command.header.requestId] = command
     }
     // Now we've sent as many commands as we can. Wait till the next PlayerMessage/commandResponse
```

Finally, in function send(), instead of `socket.send(JSON.stringify(msg))`, we use
`sendQueue.push(msg)` to add the message to the queue.

This code in is [`mineserver5.js`](mineserver5.js).

- Run `node mineserver5.js`.
- Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window.
- Then type `pyramid 6` in the chat window.
- You'll be surrounded by a large glowstone pyramid.
- The console will print messages like `setblock ~0 ~6 ~0 glowstone The block couldn't be placed`
  because we're trying to place duplicate blocks.

-----------------------------

## Count the blocks

I read that [Y=-35 is the best level for strip mining for diamonds](https://screenrant.com/minecraft-new-best-strip-mining-level-diamonds/)
in the 1.17 Caves & Cliffs Update (experimental).

To test that, I wrote [mineserver-blockcount.js](mineserver-blockcount.js). It counts blocks by
Y-level. To run it:

- Run `node mineserver-blockcount.js`.
- Then type `/connect localhost:3000` in a Minecraft chat window.
- Then type `block 100` in the chat window.
- This counts the number of blocks from the current Y level to 100 Y levels below, for a 30x30 grid around your location.
- The console will print a progress count of the number of queue size like `Queue: 334000 Awaited: 99`
- When done, `blockcount.json` has the count of blocks by level.

The results for two sample seeds and locations are at [blockcount.xlsx](blockcount.xlsx).

While this is a small sample, here are some observations:

- Coal is plentiful near the surface and is rarer at lower levels. It's nonexistent at negative Y levels.
- Deepslate starts at Y=16 downwards. In -ve Y levels, Deepslate fully takes over from Stone, Diorite, Granite, Andesite, Dirt, Gravel and Tuff, which become nonexistent
- The big caves start at Y=-30 downwards.
- Finally, diamond ore does appear somewhat more common at around Y=-40
